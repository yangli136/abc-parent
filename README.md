# abc-parent
This is parent pom for Spring Boot based application. The pom uses spring-boot-dependencies to control dependencies in order to reduce dependency related maintenance effort. The intention is that all applications will go and update along  with Spring Boot latest versions and we only define the versions that are required to be overridden here.
